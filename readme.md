# A Parallel U-Net for Monaural Speech Enhancement

This project is the implementation of parallel U-Net (PUNet). This network introduces parallel blocks to improve performance. The experimental results show that this method achieves or outperforms other models in various performance metrics.

# Requirements
To run this code, you will need:

python = 3.9.13

pytorch == 1.12.1

More details will be presented in the next update.
